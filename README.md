<h1>Project Title: Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis and Strategies</h1>
<h4>Description:</h4>
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking cancellations for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel. Due to a recent surge in booking cancellations, these hotels have been facing challenges such as reduced revenue and inefficient room occupancy. The objective of this project is to identify factors contributing to these cancellations and to propose strategic solutions to mitigate them.

<h4>Objectives:</h4></br>
1. Identify factors influencing hotel booking cancellations.</br>
2. Propose strategies to manage and reduce these cancellations.</br>
3. Assist hotels in making pricing and promotional decisions.
<h4>Methods:</h4>
We analyzed historical booking data from 2015 to 2017, under the assumption that no significant events during this period would affect the results. The analysis focused on factors such as booking prices, wait-list lengths, and the booking channels used by customers.

<h3>Key Findings:</h3></br>
1. 37% of all bookings were cancelled.</br>
2. City hotels experienced higher booking volumes than resort hotels.</br>
3. Higher prices and longer waiting lists were correlated with higher cancellation rates.</br>
4. January had the highest rate of cancellations.</br>
5. Portugal had the most cancellations among all countries.</br>
6. The majority of bookings (46%) were made through online travel agencies.
<h3>Recommendations:</h3></br>
1. Revise pricing strategies to reduce cancellations, such as offering discounts.</br>
2. Offer reasonable room price discounts for resort hotels, particularly on weekends and holidays.</br>
3. Launch marketing initiatives in January to boost revenue.</br>
4. Improve service quality in Portugal to reduce cancellations.</br>
